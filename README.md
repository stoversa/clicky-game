#Clicky Game

## Overview
This is a simple but addictive (and serverless) memory game built using React. It relies and CSS animations and the app's state to shuffle around the images available for clicking. Please enjoy!

1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and so requires npm/yarn.
